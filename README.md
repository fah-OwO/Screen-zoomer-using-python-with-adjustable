"
* mss

"

for using:

OR EDIT ANYTHING WHATEVER YOU WANT !!!


disclaimer:
I use window so I use win32api and I dont sure it will work in another platform such as ios or linux
After a lot of researching (om google) I have found that 'mss' is the best for using it to capture screen
Tkinker to make window still on top
PIL to crop image and resize

(and some time I use it in FPS game)
